This repository is for scoring with the R01/R21 Study at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 

The primary script is "R01R21 Scoring Script". This allows you to choose which tasks you would like to score for a given participant and testing date. These then utilize the functions listed in the "functions" folder to score those tasks.

Other scripts included are either to organize data or score different questionnaires.
